* I am good at listening and giving empathy.
* I can help to develop a language of life (the non-violent communication from Marshal Rosenberg) and I am good at finding the right words in a conflict situation.
* I know a lot about physics and science (that's what I teach).
* From the project Urban Challenger that I run with my brother, I constantly learn how to develop something in a lean way, how to create human centered design and how to deal with the challenges of an entrepreneur.
* One of my passions is acting and I know a couple of approaches on how to improve your acting skills, work with your body and voice, with a text or having fun developing a character.
* I can tell you a lot about positive psychology and how to develop practices of personal psychological hygiene.
* I am good at writing colourful texts and I can help editing resumes or cv`s for example (I have read quite a lot of those in my life).
* I am good at playing Go (chinese/japanese board game).
